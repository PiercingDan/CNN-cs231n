#Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
Based off [Stanford cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io/).
Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. 

This is my work on the Stanford cs231n assignments. 

In these assignments, I coded the layer architecture needed for vanilla neural networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, such as the loss functions, and the forward/backward passes for convolutional layers, pooling layers, affine layers, recurrent and LSTM layers.

I am not a Stanford student but I found the material really interesting. The assignments really helped me get an understanding for the material. Use my work as a guide if you wish but please do not plagariaze!
