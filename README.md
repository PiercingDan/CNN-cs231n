# cs231n
Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. 

This is my work on the Stanford cs231n assignments. I am not a Stanford student but I found the material really interesting. The assignments really helped me get an understanding for the material. 

Use my work as a guide if you wish but please do not plagariaze!
